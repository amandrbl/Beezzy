### About
Beezzy was designed and developed to helps teenage mothers in the process of getting back into their routine, allowing them to organize commitments and share responsibilities with their support network, thus facilitating reconciliation with their studies. 
Beezzy works like a community of bees, where the teenage mother is portrayed as the queen, and the support network as her bees, her workers. In it, the members of the support network take on the tasks that the mother places within the app, to help her both in motherhood and in her school routine.<br>
